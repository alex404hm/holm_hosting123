        <p class="pl-5">Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective immediately after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check racnhosting.com/terms for changes to these Terms.</p>

Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party's own terms of service or privacy policies.

        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">General Content & Conduct</h1>
        <p class="pl-5">Our Service allows you and other users to create Minecraft servers running third-party software. You are responsible for the content that you make available to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness. By posting content to the Service (i.e. uploading content to your server), you agree that your content is legal and appropriate. Violations of these terms may be subject to a non-refundable server cancellation or forced removal of infringing content, among other potential actions.</p>
        <p class="pl-5">You can remove the content that you uploaded by deleting it. Once you delete your content, it will not appear on the Service, but copies of your deleted content may remain in our system or backups for some period of time. We retain web server access logs indefinitely for security purposes.</p>
        <p class="pl-5">These terms prohibit uploading the following content to the Service:</p>
        <ul class="pl-10 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Content that is illegal or unlawful, that would otherwise create liability;</li>
          <li>Content that may infringe or violate any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy, right of publicity or other intellectual or other right of any party;</li>
          <li>Content designed to produce mass or repeated promotions, political campaigning or commercial messages directed at users who do not follow you (SPAM);</li>
          <li>Private information of any third party (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, healthcare-related information, and credit card numbers);</li>
          <li>Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pl-5">Also, you agree that you will not do any of the following in connection with the Service or other users:</p>
        <ul class="pl-10 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Use the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Service or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service;</li>
          <li>Impersonate or post on behalf of any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;</li>
          <li>Intimidate, threaten, stalk or otherwise harass other users of the Service;</li>
          <li>Create an account or post any content if you are not over 13 years of age years of age;</li>
          <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any filtering, security measures, rate limits or other features designed to protect the Service, users of the Service, or third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Fair Use Policy</h1>
        <p class="pl-5">The Service makes its content available to you with the additional restrictions that it follows our Fair Use Policy, applicable to all services offered. We expressly prohibit:</p>
        <ul class="pl-10 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Causing excessive load on the server through means not common for a Minecraft server.</li>
          <li>Using Bungee Hosting in a manner inconsistent with hosting BungeeCord, Waterfall, Velocity, or similar Minecraft proxy software.</li>
          <li>Storing unnecessarily large files, including those both unrelated to Minecraft and related to Minecraft.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pl-5">In many cases, we may provide clients with an “unmetered storage” policy. “Unmetered storage” applies solely to volumes that may be reasonably expected for Minecraft servers. Clients with unmetered storage may request expanded storage at any time, and these decisions will be made solely at our discretion. Reasonable requests will be approved.</p>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Holm Host's Copyrighted Materials</h1>
        <p class="pl-5">We put a lot of effort into creating the Service including the logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information and other content (excluding your content). This property is owned by us or our licensors and it is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. We grant you the right to use it.</p>
        <p class="pl-5">However, unless we expressly state otherwise, your rights do not include: (i) publicly performing or publicly displaying the Service; (ii) modifying or otherwise making any derivative uses of the Service or any portion thereof; (iii) using any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods; (iv) downloading (other than page caching) of any portion of the Service or any information contained therein; (v) reverse engineering or accessing the Service in order to build a competitive product or service; or (vi) using the Service other than for its intended purposes. Violations may result in termination of your use of the Service.</p>
        <p class="pl-5">Exceptions for many of the pages of the Service may be available on an open-source code repository. If the repository exists and contains licenses, your actions must be guided by these licenses. If the repository either does not exist or does not contain licenses, it is assumed to be unlicensed for reuse in any way.</p>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="pl-5">We grant all hosting plans a 3-day (72-hour) refund policy, provided that the plan has not violated any of these Terms. The refund will be issued to the initial form of payment. Refunds must be requested through a Discord ticket created by the verified owner of the server. Chargebacks are explicitly prohibited and constitute a violation of these terms, voiding all refund options and prohibiting the user from accessing our services.</p>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Reimbursement Policy</h1>
        <p class="pl-5">As a nonprofit, we have made the decision to provide periodic reimbursments to clients based on excess profit from their plans. Reimbursments rates vary from period-to-period, and rates may range from 0% - 100%. Generally, reimbursements are announced and distrubuted quarterly. Clients receive reimbursements as a percentage of their external transactions from each quarter, categorized to the best of our ability into the US reimbursement rate, the EU reimbursement rate, or a combination of the two based on plans held by the client. Internal credits are not eligible for reimbursement.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        A reimbursement rate will be announced within 15 days of the end of the reimbursement period, and all active clients will be reimbursed at this rate within 31 days of the end of the reimbursement period. Active clients are defined as users that have at least one active (i.e. not canceled nor suspended) service hosted on Holm Host at the time of reimbursement receipt. All reimbursements will be issued as credit to client accounts.</p>

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO Holm Host.
